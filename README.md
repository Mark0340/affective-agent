# Affective Agent â€” Pre-Human-Trials Package (v4.1)

This repository hosts the **pilot-ready package** for running and validating an affective computing agent that integrates interoceptive signals (EDA, HR, Respiration) into predictive processing and global workspace dynamics.

## ðŸš€ Overview
The Affective Agent is designed for research and pilot validation. It provides a modular implementation for integrating synthetic and real physiological data into cognitive-affective architectures. The package supports ablation controls, signal ingestion, and automated quality checks.

## ðŸ“¦ Contents
- âœ… Reference agent implementation with ablation controls  
- âœ… Synthetic physiology generator (baseline â†’ stress â†’ recovery)  
- âœ… Data ingestion (CSV adapter, event/marker aligner, self-report forms)  
- âœ… Quality control scripts and validation tools  
- âœ… Pilot-ready configuration (pre-human-trials)

## âš¡ Quickstart
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mark0340/affective-agent.git
   cd affective-agent
   ```

2. Unzip the essentials package (from Releases):
   ```bash
   unzip pretrial-essentials-v4_1.zip -d ./essentials
   ```

3. Run the reference agent:
   ```bash
   python run_agent.py --config essentials/config.yaml
   ```

## ðŸ“Š Validation Workflow
1. Generate synthetic physiology data.  
2. Run the agent with/without ablation controls.  
3. Align results with event markers and self-report forms.  
4. Review quality control metrics.
