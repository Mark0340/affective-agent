# Affective Agent Prototype  
**Author:** Mark Purvis  

This is the first working prototype that links interoception, prediction error, and a global workspace into a testable model of **emotion & consciousness**.

## ðŸ“¦ Whatâ€™s Inside
- **src/** â†’ core source code (`affective_agent.py`)  
- **scripts/** â†’ simulation scripts (threat, recovery, control comparison)  
- **tests/** â†’ simple tests to validate model behavior  
- **paper/** â†’ draft write-up with theory, design, and results  
- **figures/** â†’ plots of valence/arousal from simulations  
- **affective_agent_whitepaper.pdf** â†’ full whitepaper with results + diagrams  

---

## ðŸš€ Quickstart
1. Clone or download this repository  
2. Run a simulation:  
   ```bash
   python scripts/simulate.pypytest
## Final Validation Summary
- âœ… Complexity metrics show rich internal dynamics (entropy > 2.5).
- âœ… Perturbations yield correct causal signs (EDA â†‘ â†’ arousal â†‘, valence â†“).
- âœ… Ablations confirm all components contribute.
- âœ… Baselines weaker than full model.
- âœ… Robust to realistic noise and latency.
